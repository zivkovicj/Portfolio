      <h4>As a middle school math teacher (16 years!), I wanted to find a way to make my classroom more individualized
        to meet each student's unique needs.</h4>
      <h4>No apps existed to help with this, so I learned back-end development in order to make a web app that arranges
        students into groups based on the topics that they need to study. </h4>
      <h4>Nearly 1,000 students have benefitted from customized learning experiences thanks to Mr. Z School, in my own classroom, and in the classrooms of four other teachers from three different states.</h4>
