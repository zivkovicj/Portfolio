        <h4>As a middle school math teacher (16 years!), I searched for ways to make my classroom more individualized.
          My students had unique needs, and the curriculum wasn't working for most of them.</h4>
        <h4>No apps existed to help with this, so I learned back-end development in order to make a web app that
          arranges
          students into groups based on the topics that they need to study. </h4>
        <h4>Nearly 1,000 students have benefitted from customized learning experiences thanks to Mr. Z School, in my
          own
          classroom, and in the classrooms of four other teachers from three different states.</h4>
